# Inscryption Augmented Card Graphic Generator
script to automatically assemble playing card graphics from data hosted on a spreadsheet.
I did not make most of these graphics. Most of them are attributed to Pixel Profligate (#5078). Other known contributors include, in no particular order:

## How to use

There are plans to collaborate and make a web-hosted interface for generating individual cards, but for now this version is intended to be manually installed and run, as it sources from a Google Office spreadsheet that it treats as a database. 

Enter a single card's name to output one card. Enter the names of two cards, separated by a comma (but not a space, e.g. `bee,cat`) to output all cards between them, inclusive.

Card names are case-insensitive but spelling and spaces do matter.

Add an optional argument of `1` after two card names to output cards sorted into folders by temple and tier. (e.g., `Squirrel,Magnus Mox,1`)

**To install:**

It should run standalone now hopefully!!! Run dist/printer/printer.exe to use.

**To make custom cards:**

* Create a copy of the [card info spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvTXSsFDK5xAVALQPdDPJOitBufJE6UB_MN4q5nbLXk/)
	* In the top left, click **File** â†’ **Make a Copy**
	* NOTE: The included spreadsheet has data validation to limit entries to the four temples included in the base game. You will need to edit it to support custom temples.
* Edit `printerconfig.py` and replace the ID part of the url (in line 8) with that of your own sheet copy.
* Refer to the instructions in `printerconfig.py` for adding custom costs and certain types of custom sigils.
